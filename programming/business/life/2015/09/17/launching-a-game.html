  <article class="post-content">
    <p>So this is it, a new blog on a new domain for a new business with some new projects underway. A lot can happen in a matter of months, and for me the past year has been a remarkably steady march of positive change. Which is a good thing considering how dramatic and traumatic the 18 months or so prior had been.</p>

<p>But really, months? Who am I kidding. My life had been a chaotic spiral for years before slamming into a wall last November. If you know me, or knew me then, you’ve got some idea. The mania and mood swings, the days of ferocious energy interspersed with weeks of listless withdrawal.</p>

<p>The cause? Misdiagnosis and addiction. Trading a lifetime of clear eyed anxiety for a few years of endless off-kilter energy … and then a crash back to reality. A constant hum of anxiety. Either too wound up to stop, or too agitated to start, like a gyroscope spinning around.</p>

<p>I ‘suffer’ from bipolar disorder, but unfortunately I’d been diagnosed with ADHD and medicated with stimulants. Which I liked. <span class="coming-soon">A lot.</span> Over the course of several years the side-effects got worse and worse, and I was less and less able to see the issues with my own behavior and my own thinking. In my mind the agitation and sleeplessness were a small price to pay for how much better I felt and how much more productive I was. Even if that productivity was mostly in my own head.</p>

<p>Getting cleaned up and back on track meant making a sustained effort  at confronting reality and turning away from the illusions I’d built up around myself. Its amazing how deep I’d buried the shame of repeated failure, the embarassment at erratic behavior, the confusion, the sense of inevitability of it all. Things seemed pretty hopeless. They really did. Until they didn’t.</p>

<p>Bottoming out happens slowly then suddenly, and getting better is the same. It wasn’t all at once, and there wasn’t anything dramatic, but the downward spiral reversed its course. Slowly, one step at a time. It goes a little something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get out of bed. Go to the doctor. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.</li>
  <li>Get out of bed. Take your pills. Go to the gym. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.</li>
  <li>Get out of bed. Take your pills. Go to the gym. Spend time with family. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.</li>
  <li>Get out of bed. Take your pills. Fire up Xcode. Go to the gym. Spend time with family. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.</li>
  <li>Get out of bed. Realize you’re living a normal life. <span class="coming-soon"><em>Pray that it continues to repeat.</em></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Physically, mentally, spiritually, I don’t feel at all like the same person I was a couple years ago. Which is a little scary, as theres always the chance of backsliding. But somehow, this time I think its different. I’ve found that physical fitness and mental exercise in the form of meditation and mindfulness practices have worked wonders on my mood and thinking. The medication and therapy can get you to OK, but beyond that took some more work.</p>

<p>Of course I wouldn’t be writing any of this if it weren’t for my family and friends who stuck by me at my worst. You know who you are. Thanks, it couldn’t have been easy.</p>
