  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This morning I launched Generous Portions, my first game for iOS. Not counting various pencil &amp; paper RPGs I’ve had a part in developing or playing over the years, this is the first game I’ve published at all.</p>

<p>Although its very simple, the experience taught me just how difficult it is to develop an enjoyable game. Managing just one or two basic mechanics in a video game is in many ways harder than developing complex rulesets for use in a pencil and paper RPG session. So much goes into the process! Determining how much of the gane is immediately grokkable, whether or not the primary mechanic provides a suitable amount of ‘fun’ in the form of regular meaningful choices - and maybe trickiest of all: understanding what the player will experience as the appropriate level of challenge.</p>

<p>In GP, for instance, much of the game itself is, for lack of a better word, noise. SPOILER: The salient variables are very easy to track as long as the player avoids the distraction of trying to watch and predict the actions of all the customers.</p>

<p>I spent many hours of development time tweaking and adjusting the behavior of the customers. The goal was that each would have an easily distinguishable path and velocity - so that players could anticipate which food tray the customer would be approaching, and plan their refills appropriately.</p>

<p>This was, simply, too much to ask of the player - and the game! Trying to find the right balance between so many variables felt impossible.</p>

<p>So I simplified the process: the challenge would no longer be to predict every customer’s movement and react with lightning speed. Instead the game would be one of simple timing: managing to wait long enough for each food tray to produce more than the cost of refilling it.</p>

<p>Positions and vectors no longer mattered. As a result, players could actually manage to keep track of the salient variables: how much food they had in each tray, how many points they had to spend on refills, and how quickly new customers were being spawned.</p>

<p>By creating a gradually ramping wavelike spawn-rate, the game’s difficulty could increase over time while still providing a sense of relief in the troughs of the waves.</p>

<p>Now the challenge, and sense of reward came from lasting longer, beating ones previous time, and getting to the top of the leaderboards.</p>

<p>Just like an old school arcade game.</p>

<p>Is it a genious game? Not at all. But its shipped, and I’m both happy to be done with it and curious to see how it will fare on the store.</p>

<p>And I think I may have been bitten by the game-design bug. Which may be more fun than playing games themselves.</p>
