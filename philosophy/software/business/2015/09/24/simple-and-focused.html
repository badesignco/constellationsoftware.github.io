    <p>One of the things I am always on the lookout for is conceptual symmetry. I love to find an aspect of a particular process that mirrors another, seemingly dissimilar systems. Finding these mirrors can help untangle messy challenges in our personal or professional lives. So when I found myself struggling to define in words just what Constellation was about, I looked for similarities in the process of app development itself.</p>

<p>You see, I’m pretty new to iOS development. While I’d taken some online Objective-C courses, and I’ve developed using Ruby &amp; Javascript for years, Apple’s platform remained intimidatingly opaque. Until Swift, that is. Suddently there was a focal point, a simple way to move forward with a lot of other beginners. And I loved that.</p>

<p>The excitement of learning a new language and process for a rapidly growing and extremely dynamic platform is hard to express, but the downside is the scale of what there is to master. There are so many tools to learn, so many documents to read, so many libraries to draw on, its hard to imagine ever been truly competent, let alone an expert.</p>

<p>The challenges are as big as the opportunities.</p>

<p>And I know for a fact: I’m not the smartest or best programmer out there, not by a long shot. Actually I’d say I’m pretty slow and stodgy. I like elegant code but I like understandable code better. So how can I make a mark?</p>

<p>Well, I believe its right in the name. A Constellation of apps. A collection of small, very focused and deeply considered tools. Maintained and grown over time, with modest but fair revenue models.</p>

<p>I’ve used so many apps that clearly suffered from kitchen sink design. Apps that seemed so promising up front but almost instantly deflected me away from use with excessive complexity and unopinionated design.</p>

<p>I believe users are hungry for - and willing to support - the opposite of this style of development. The only caveat is sustainable success will likely require keeping a number of balls in the air at one time.</p>

<p>How many? I can’t say. Maybe half a dozen or more in active development at any one time? From what I’ve learned reading and listening to podcasts this approach seems relatively safe - and the one that offers the best chance to work on an assortment of real, <em>solvable</em> problems and do <em>good</em> work at the same time.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see where this goes.</p>
